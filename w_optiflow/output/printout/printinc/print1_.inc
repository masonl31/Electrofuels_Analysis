* File last time modified 27-09-2002 (rus) , 05-08-2003 (sns), hr 20110920, hr 20121001.

* This file is part of the Balmorel model, version 3.03 ()

* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Contents:

* This file contains definitions of logical file names
* and the associated names of files
* that may be used for printout of simulation results.
* It also contains definitions of various sets etc. that is useful for the
* production and alyout of the output.

* The individual output file is used by the print code that is contained in
* the $included files in the print2.inc file, which is called in the end of
* the Balmorel.gms file.

* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* SETS, PARAMETERS, ect.  useful for the production of the output.


* The following is used for identification of your case if OCASEID was not previously declared:
SCALAR OCASEID "Balmorel Demo-example - default CASE identification";

SCALAR OIMONEY "EUR90" /1/;

PARAMETER OCARDSETA;  /* To hold the number of areas in the simulation */
OCARDSETA=0;
LOOP(IA, OCARDSETA=OCARDSETA+1);

PARAMETER OCARDSETR;  /* To hold the number of regions in the simulation */
OCARDSETR=0;
LOOP(IR, OCARDSETR=OCARDSETR+1);

PARAMETER OSCALAR1, OSCALAR2, OSCALAR3; /* Various general counters */

* For printing: OTLW, OTLW1, OTLG, OTL1, OTLCRA for specifying field widths in printing:
* Note that the text strings (OTLW.ts etc.) must contain the same number of blanks as the value indicates.
* Present choice: 32, consistent with the maximal length of identifiers and labels in GAMS before version 22.7.
* OTLW1 is meant for text labels that are known to be 'small', e.g. for years Y that are four characters long.
*
