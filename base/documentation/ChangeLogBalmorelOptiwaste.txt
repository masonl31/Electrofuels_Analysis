* ===================== BACKGROUND COMMENTS  ==========================================================================
* =====================================================================================================================

 - The geography structure of the Balmorel data shall be changed to the one used in Optiwaste, to facilitate linking of Balmorel and Optiwaste.
   Do not delete the present data from 'fjernvarmemodellen'. Whenever errors are found in the parts reused for Optiwaste, also the Fjernvarmemodellens data should, of ourse be corrected.

- The model at O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\ is not for analyses.
   It is to be considered a repository where the most recent version is kept.
   To make analyses make a copy to somewhere else.
   Therefore:
      whenever there are changes here they should be documented and then communicated to all the users
      whenever an error is found and corrected during analyses, it should be fed back to the repository.

- The model at O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\ is for analyses.
   The geography structure of the Balmorel data is the same used in Optiwaste, to facilitate linking of Balmorel and Optiwaste.


- Observe the Balmorel ideas about a 'base' case and possibly a number of other cases, all placed under the same project folder (presently Balmorel303_20141016 at the O drive).
   The base case contains all code, while any non-base case do not contain any. Non-base cases contain only output and a certain selection of other files.
   Both base and any non-base cases contain the following folders with content
     data    with files that differ from those in base/data
     logerror
     model   with files balgams.opt, balopt.opt. (more?)
     output  with subfolders economic, inputout, intermed printout and temp.
   The reason for this is to ensure that there is one and only one set of code within the project.
   A non-base case may be run from the gams project in the base/model by using certain command in the command line. I can show which ones if needed.
   A non-base case may also be run from the model folder of the case, however, to do this a copy of the Balmorel.gms files has to be placed there.

 - Revised data files should be placed in a separate folder outside the project folder, presently e.g. O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\datamine
   These files cannot have the name as required by Balmorel because there will be more versions of the same Balmorel ID (identifier), so use e.g. FUELPRICE_IEA2008.inc, FUELPRICE_IEA2012.inc, FUELPRICE_DEA2014.inc etc.
   When used, copy to the data folder of the relevant case and the rename as required by Balmorel, FUELPRICE.inc in the example.

- A new folder named at O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\base\Literature has the purpose to collect all the sources,
  for facilitating the review of that. Please for any modification of the model, provide the source in the "literature" folder.

- Write a line in the headline of each .inc file which have been modified: *Last time modified (Name, dd-mm-yy) + source.

- Note that "***" and "****" have special meaning in GAMS, therefore do not use such strings for comments.

- ERROR: There are 2 errors in the printing files due to a division by zero caused by the change of parameter GEFFRATE in the files  "f_fcy.inc" at
    O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\base\output\printout\printinc
         Comment 20150505: Davide, please change it, the cause is 'the usual suspect' GEFFDERATE, the fix for that is the usual one.
                           Note that you can avoid seeing this error by setting "$setglobal PRINTFILES" in balopt.opt



- Run a simulation and check that Wind production and Solar electricity/Solar heating are consistent with data found by Raffaele (Source:Energinet.dk), found in this directory:
  O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\OptiWaste_link\literature\Energinet_profile

- To correct the errors at "errors.out"  at O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\base\logerror

- I (hr) worked from home, in the material I have I observed:
        data/wnd_var_t.inc   has a line    $include '..\data/WND_VAR_T2.inc';                                    I cannot find that file. I outcommented the line.
        data/wawe_var_t.inc  has a line    $if not EXIST 'DK_W_wave.inc' $INCLUDE '..\data/DK_W_wave.inc' ;      I cannot find that file. I outcommented the line.
        Please clarify somehow.

- (dc) Chose which DE scenario include in the simulation among DE-base; DE-Bio; DE-Wind. (Data are available in the "Datamine" folder).

- (hr) Se "TODO" under 20150518 below

- In the GDATASET - the units of the parameter GDUCUCOST (start-up cost of a unit) are expressed as Money. However, according to the unit commitment program in
  ...\base\addons\unitcommitment\qobjadd.inc
  the units of the parameter should be Money/MW, as the cost associated to ramp up a unit is GDUCOST*GDUCUNITSIZE

dc: Davide Conti
ap: Amalia Pizarro

-  20150430(hr): added two lines immediately above the declaration of variables in Balmorel.gms:
                 * No need to proceed further if there are compilation errors in the data:
                 $ifi not errorfree $goto endofmodel

-  20150501(dc): #1 changed the directory for both models: 1) A repository model to do not use for analysis;
                  2) A model developed to be linked with Optiwaste. (see "BACKGROUND COMMENTS", above).

                 #2 Created a folder named: "Datamine" at -  O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\datamine ; whose
                        purpose is exaplained in ("BACKGROUND COMMENTS", above). All the data which have been modified for Optiwaste are reported in this folder.

                 #3 Changed to relative paths of all files, (to make the model independent of where the model is located)


                 #4 Updating completed for Balmorel (for Optiwaste linking ):
                        - New geographical structure, (same of Optiwaste)
                        - Added a new FUEL: "HAZARDOUSWASTE"
                        - FDATA and FACRONYM contain the new fuel
                        - Update the DH demand for all new areas in DK for years 2012-2025-2035-2050
                        - GDATA updated (Amalia.. )
                        - Added new GGG, G (Generation Technologies)
                        - Associated new G to new geographical structure in GKFX
                        - Checked that DISLOSS_H and DISLOSS_E have updated values (source: Energinet.dk )
                                O:\MAN\ESY-ALL\ESY\Topwaste\WP4\Davide\Optiwastlink\Fjernvarmemodellen\B303\Balmorel303_20140501\OptiWaste_link\literature\Transmission

- 20150505(hr):  improved the 20150430 modification, replaced by  $ifi not errorfree $abort "Balmorel execution aborted because of data errors"

                 Improved the 20150501 modification of relative paths, using e.g. $include '..\data/var2001/DK_CA_Kbh_WND_VAR_T.inc';
                 Reason: the 'project folder' (cf. above) name should not appear in the paths, to permit renaming project or copying a project to another place with anoher name.

                 balopt.opt: changed $setglobal XKDERATE_DOL IRRRE_IRRRI_SSS_TTT  to $setglobal XKRATE_DOL IRRRE_IRRRI_SSS_TTT

                 data/XKRATE.inc: modified content to contain only non-default values (default is 1). This changed size of file from 6.7 MB to 0.2 MB.

                 balmorel.gms: modified assignment of PARAMETER IXKRATE to handle also DOL and default values.

                 Deleted a number of .svn folders (they not in use). If I forgot some, please delete them.

- 20150505(hr):  File FDATA.inc: Changed to Table format (original at bottom of file for verification; Davide, please verify, correct if needed, then delete).
                 Replaced numbers by acronyms in field FDACRONYM
                 Note the field FDRE: this is to be used for specification of fossil/biogen CO2: "Share of fuel considered renewable ([1;0])"

                 Modified error2.inc wrt. _VAR_T on DH and DE.
                 Modified error4.inc wrt. printing to errorfile.

- 20150506(dc):  Updating data in Balmorel:

                 - DH: include Gross demand for DK
                 - DISLOSS_H, Set to zero the heat distribution loss for DK,
                 - DE: Include Gross demand for countries: Finland, Norway, Sweden ( year 2012, 2025, 2035, 2050 )

                 In "Datamine" folder, there are DE for all three different scenarios:
                        DE-base
                        DE-Bio
                        DE-Wind

- 20150507 (ap) fix ERROR: There is 1 erros in the model due to a division by zero, caused by GEFFRATE
         20150505: NO, the error is from DATA(*,'GDFE').
         For the data set used (4 Nordig plus germany) technologies 'DK_CA_Esb_DEC_GasTur_LO_CND' and 'DK_MA_Grenaa_DEC_GasTur_LO_CND' miss values in GDATA.
         This is verified by adding two lines at the bottom of GDATA.inc:
             GDATA('DK_CA_Esb_DEC_GasTur_LO_CND', 'GDFE') = 0.5;    !! Tester Hans
             GDATA('DK_MA_Grenaa_DEC_GasTur_LO_CND', 'GDFE') = 0.5; !! Tester Hans
         Please supply data.
         Also note that: (1) there may be more data items missing in GDATA, and (2) I have run only with the five mentioned countries.
         Also note that this is actually noted already in errors.out, search "Error in table GDATA:   The fuel efficiency for technology".



- 20150507 (ap)Investments in solar thermal not expressed any more in m2, but in MW. Change in the GDATA file and SOLHFLH.inc document, in order to reflect that change .

- 20150507 (ap) Update GEQF.inc, in order to reflec the actual MSW requirements in Denmark and the surroinding countries. Values for Denmark have been updated according to FRIDA model forecasts .

- 20150507 (ap) Set power transmission loss as 0

- 20150507 SFH, solar full load hours fixed


- 20150510(dc): - Included DE for Germany ( year 2012, 2025, 2035, 2050 )
                - Updated DE_VAR_T for DK_E and DK_W (starting by Monday)
                - Updated WND_VAR_T for DK_CA_kbh, DK_CA_Aarhus, DK_E_Onshore, DK_W_Offshore, (for years 2010, -20, -35, -50), starting by Monday
                - Updated XINVCOST for all transmission between ( DK_E, DK_W, FI_R, DE_CS, DE_NE,DE_NW, NO_M, NO_N,NO_O, NO_S, SE_M, SE_N,SE_S) ( considering currency C.F:)
                - Updated SOLH_VAR_T
                - Updated SOLE_VAR_T

                 For all the sources: look at the literature folder.


- 20150510 (dc) To Check electricity transmision capacity / potential future investment and costs.


- 20150510 (ap) Update fuel prices for 2012 and future years.

- 20150512(hr) Added ISCALAR5 to Balmorel.gms
               Revised printinc/f_fcy.inc ot avoid division-by-zero error
               Added simex folder
               In balopt.opt: changed option value for HYRSBB123 to    $setglobal HYRSBB123 none
               Changed XKDERATE TO XKRATE bALMOREL.GMS, BALOPT.OPT, AND DATA FILES.



- 20150512 (ap) Update WNDFLH data with the current full load hours of operation of installed wind mills in Denmark - Future WNDFLH is not changed, as it will also depend on technology development

- 20150518(hr): Changed path in  WTRRRVAR_T:inc to be more 'local':     $include '..\data/var2001/Baltic-WTRRRVAR_T.inc';
                error4.inc: deleted line    vqeeq.l(ir,s,t,iplusminus) = 2;
                Removed 2 display statements from printout/printinc/hyrs_as.inc.
                Slightly revised error2.inc and error3.inc to make them more informative in the present context.
                There are many observations reported in errors.out. Seems that many are related to items that are not in use. Therefore as follows:
                Technologies: File testfile_G.out in present folder there is a list of all technologies (set GGG), with indication of whether they were originally in G (they all were) and have non-zero data i GDATA (The latter I decided from looking at data file).
                   I outcommented lines in GDATA.inc that have zero data in GDATA, search "* Zero-data". I made new file G.inc without such G (the original one saved in data folder).
                   Code used for this was inserted i Balmorel.gms immediately before "* Declarations and inclusion of data files:"  :
                        $INCLUDE  "..\DATA\GGG.INC";
                        $INCLUDE  "..\DATA\G.INC";
                        $INCLUDE  "UNTITLED_1.GMS";

                          PUT GGG.TL:40;
                          IF(G(GGG), PUT "YES   ";);
                          IF(TESTER_G_GDATA(GGG), PUT "YES   ";);

                          PUT /;
                        );
                        FILE TESTFILE3 /TESTFILE3.out/;
                        PUT TESTFILE3 "valid G"/;
                        LOOP(GGG,
                          IF(((G(GGG) AND TESTER_G_GDATA(GGG))),  PUT GGG.TL:50 /;);

                Balmorel.gms: Changed value definition of SCALAR IOF1_  from    /0.000001/    to  /1/
                TODO: GKFX.inc: added more data for DK_CA_Aarhus due to infeasibility on heat side. Search "20150519".  Must be checked.
                TODO: more heat infeasibilities:  SE_N_Rural, SE_M_Urban, SE_M_Rural, SE_S_Rural:  no heat demand, but production.
                     Added demand for SE_N_Rural, SE_M_Urban, SE_M_Rural, SE_S_Rural from original data file. Must be checked.
                bb123.sim: removed assignments og IGKRATE, IXKRATE; ensured they are in Balmorel.gms.
                output/printout/printinc: print1.inc, ep_rt.inc and hp_at.inc: slight beautification, along with change of text in data/omoney.inc.
                TODO: What is the output currency? Insert in data/OMONEY.inc where presently is used    SCALAR OMONEY  'DKK2012'
                TODO: Deleted the single element in DEF_D2. TODO: Should it be there?

- 20150520(dc): Assigned DE_VAR_T profiles for missing regions in Norway and Germany.
                Assigned DH_VAR_T profiles for missing areas in Dk, using rural profile of relative regions (DK_E, DK_W)
                Assigned WND_VAR_T profiles for missing areas in DK, using onshore profile of relative regions
                Assigned SOLE_VAR_T profiles for missing areas in DK.

- 20150527 (ap) Update GKFX with the installed capacity from plants in Denmark (Energy Producer Account) and wind mills (ENS data).

- 20150527 (ap) Update values in GDATA file with efficiencies about current energy plants (Energy Producer Account) and using costs from the Fjernevarme rapport (EA).
                Values have also been updated for investment in new technologies, according to data from the "Technology Data for Energy Plants", when possible; or to data
                from the Nordic Energy Research Council.

- 20150527 (ap) Update values about areas where it is possible to invest in specific types of technologies in AGKN.

- 20150527 (ap) Update available and future plants in G and GGG files. Plants whose parameters in GDATA were 0, and which are not in used in the model are removed from those files.

- 20150527 (ap) Update values in GINVCOST, GOMFCOST and GMOVCOST; in order to match with the available plants in G file.

- 20150527 (ap) TAX_GE, TAX_GF and TAX_GH are put offline on the text, as our optimization is from a socioeconomic point of view.
                Reconsider how these variables are used, as, i.e in TAX_GE there are more than 500.000 input data, which makes any modification
                very complex.

- 20150604 (ap) Define in DE.inc gross power production in Denmark and in the surrounding countries (NW, SW, DE & FI).
                For all the countries it is assumed the same classic electricity consumption and a demand for transport, that will depend on the specific scenario we are simulated.
                For Denmark, there is also included electricity consumption for process heat, which will follow an industrial demand profile.
                The amount of electricity demanded in every Region of every Country, depends on the share of DE demand in that specific Region from the Fjernvarme report.

- 20150604 (ap) Power transmission loss between RRR for EV (electric vehicles) and the classic RRR are set to 0 in XLOSS file
                Attention!!! We do not have included vehicle to power modelling. In case we do, in order to avoid artificial flows going from one Region to another (as loss are 0), we might set a tiny cost.

- 20150604 (ap) In the file FUELPRICE, the price for WP_CCS was missing. This price has been added, considered the same price than Wood_pellets.

- 20150604 (ap) DH demand for NW, SW, DE & FI has been added. The amount of heat demanded in every Area of every Country, depends on the share of DH demand in that specific Area from the Fjernvarme report.

- 20150604 (ap) Two new Areas (in West and East) Denmark has been defined for heat pumps for individual heating: DK_E_IndETOH and DK_W_IndETOH. This has only been done for the case of Denmark, as there was no data available for the other countries.
                The heat demand is defined in DH, as the heat provided for individual heat pumps (it is not a district heating itself)
                The same DH_VAR_T profile than for KBH (Denmark-East) and Aar (Denmark-West) have been given.
                The individual heating is provided by heat pumps, whose efficiency increase along the years, as defined specifically in GDATA (HeatPump-Ind-YY).
                A heat storage equivalent to the maximumd heat demand during 2 hours has been established in GKFX.


- 20150604 (ap) Changes in the Balmorel code as the GDATASET of GDFUEL does not represent anymore the FDATASET of FDNB but it shows FDACRONYM.
                In the code, there were still some places where the parameter FDATA was making reference to FDNB when related to GDFUEL, instead of to FDACRONYM, as it should be.

- 20151027 (hr) Introduced bypass option for BPR units. Changes in files B.gms, balopt.opt, gdataset.inc, gdata.inc. Search "bypass".
